This repo hosts the landing site for Natural Essentials Inc.

## JAMStack with Netlify and Gatsby

Our current site at <https://naturalessentialsinc.com> is hosted on, and
generated by, GoDaddy. The advantage of this configuration is that it allowed
us to use GoDaddy's CMS to create and maintain the site via their no/low-code
interface. The site generated by this tool performed well on mobile lighthouse
tests, but the desktop site's performance suffered, and SEO and
accessibility scores were suboptimal for both versions.

### Lighthouse scores, GoDaddy mobile site

![Old site (GoDaddy), lighthouse scores, mobile][1]

As this is, for the most part, a completely static site, it seemed a excellent
opportunity to try out Gatsby, the static site generator.

Below are details to
set up the project locally (for development) and to deploy to Netlify.
