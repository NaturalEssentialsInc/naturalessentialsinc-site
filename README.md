## Upgrading from GoDaddy's site generator 

Our current site at <https://naturalessentialsinc.com> is hosted on, and
generated by, GoDaddy. The advantage of this configuration is that it allowed
us to use GoDaddy's CMS to create and maintain the site via their no/low-code
interface. The site generated by this tool performed well on mobile lighthouse
tests, but the desktop site's performance suffered, and "best practices" and
accessibility scores were suboptimal for both versions.

### Lighthouse scores, GoDaddy mobile site

## JAMStack with Gatsby and Netlify

We could probably make changes through the GoDaddy CMS and address many of these
lighthouse scores, but, as this is, for the most part, a completely static site,
and we had limited access to the GoDaddy CMS internally, it seemed an excellent
opportunity to try out Gatsby, the static site generator and to dip our toe into
the JAMStack.

### Setup for local development

1. Download and install [nodejs][3] and npm if you don't have them running
  already.
2. Install the gatsby-cli with `npm install gatsby-cli -g`
